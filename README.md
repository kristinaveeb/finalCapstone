# User Registration System

# Overview
The User Registration System is a simple Python program designed to allow users to register by providing a username and password. This system then stores the user information in a text file for future reference.

# Features
- Allows users to register by providing a username and password.
- Validates the password by confirming it with the user.
- Stores the user information securely in a text file.
- Provides feedback to the user during the registration process.

# Getting Started
To use the User Registration System, follow these steps:

1. *Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/user-registration-system.git
   ```
2. *Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd user-registration-system
   ```
3. *Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. *Follow the On-Screen Instructions**:
   - You will be prompted to enter a new username.
   - You will then be asked to provide a new password and confirm it.
   - If the passwords match, a new user will be added, and the information will be stored in a file named `user.txt`.
   - If the passwords do not match, an error message will be displayed, and you will be prompted to try again.

# File Structure
- `main.py`: Contains the main functionality of the User Registration System.
- `user.txt`: Stores the registered user information in the format `username;password`.

# Usage
- The User Registration System can be integrated into larger applications that require user authentication.
- It can serve as a template for building more complex user management systems.
- Developers can extend its functionality by adding features such as email verification, password strength checks, etc.
